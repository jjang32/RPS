This is a research project conducted from June 2019 to August 2019, where I coded and tested the performances of different machine learning algorithms in their ability to accurately and efficiently predict human input in Rock Paper Scissors. 
I then created a user interface that displayed the different algorithms and allowed users to play multiple trials of RPS.
