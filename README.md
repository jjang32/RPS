This is a research project conducted from June 2019 to August 2019 at the University of Southern California with Professor Haipeng Luo, where I coded and tested the performances of different machine learning algorithms in their ability to accurately and efficiently predict human input in Rock Paper Scissors. 
I then created a user interface that displayed the different algorithms and allowed users to play multiple trials of RPS so that they can witness the perfomance accuracy and efficiency of the different algorithms.
